# ATSC-528 Atmospheric Data Analysis; Fall 2022

This is a repository for the University of North Dakota Atmospheric Data Analysis course (ATSC 528) for Fall 2022.  This repository includes directories holding all the required/necessary files for the course assignments.  Also in each directory are basic files indicing what/how things should be documented.

These labs/assignments are developed around the *Atmospheric Data Analysis* text by Roger Daley (ISBN:978-0521458252) and build upon previous course iterations from Dr. Mark Askelson at the University of North Dakota.
